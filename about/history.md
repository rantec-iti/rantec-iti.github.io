> Ranchi Television and Electronics Training Centre from its birth in 1986 in Ranchi, Piskamore and later on in Adityapur, Jamshedpur had its goal well checked out. It was made to achieve higher excellence in Technology and to enhance the skill of Technical minded citizens of Jharkhand. From a meager one classroom rented building to a strong and vastly spread out infrastructure is quite a long story of more than 30 years. It has reached out to the population from merely Ranchi township to the entire Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa population. Though the name of the institution has been curtailed to RANTEC, Its work has diversified from mere training of the well to do society, to rehabilitation of the underprivileged society also.

> Our goal has always been to reach excellence in skill enhancing with modern techniques and experiences trainees.
